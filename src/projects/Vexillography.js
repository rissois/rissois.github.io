  description: ['A flag means nothing without a group of individuals who seek a common identity and willingness to attach meaning to a collection of symbols. The ability to connect deeply with these designs, with passion and pride, is a unique characteristic of human culture and psyche. They are in essence a highly effective form of market that build both brand awareness and loyalty.',
    'Some of these flags were created for r/vexillology (600k members) and their monthly flag contests, others for fun. I help build and maintain the contest site as well.'],
